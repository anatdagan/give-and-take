# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Give & Take.
This project is all about giving:
 
* The people who donate food, clothes, and other goods 
* The help organizations who collect the goods and pass them to those in need
* The drivers who transport the goods 
* The developers that work on the app.

Every contribution gives this project a better chance to succeed and bring the joy of giving to many people.

## Why should you follow these guidelines?
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## What contributions are we looking for?
Give & Take is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community.
The project is in an early stage, so you can make a lot of impact.
You can assist with the design, architecture, documentation, bug fixes, adding features and more. 





# Ground Rules


 Responsibilities

 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
 * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.



# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.

    * Send a pull request 

# How to report a bug
 If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email gntinfo81@gmail.com instead.
 

 When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:


1. What operating system are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Give & Take, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.



# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a weekly basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
